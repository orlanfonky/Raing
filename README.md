This repository was developed as part of my Masterâ€™s thesis, with the aim of exploring how Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can be enhanced through Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to improve the detection and verification of fake news.
The project focuses on building a graph-based pipeline where:

* Entities and relations are extracted from text using Stanza (Stanford NLP library).https://github.com/stanfordnlp/stanza

* Extracted information is converted into a knowledge graph, enabling structured representation of news content.

* Communities of entities are detected and summarized, supporting a more diverse and exhaustive retrieval process.

* These graphs are integrated into a RAG framework to provide contextually rich and verifiable responses.

By combining graph-based representations, embeddings, and LLM-based generation, the system aims to demonstrate the potential of hybrid architectures in handling multi-topic and large-scale datasets for misinformation detection.
